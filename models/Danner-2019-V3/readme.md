Model files for Danner SM, Zhang H, Shevtsova NA, Borowska-Fielding J, Deska-Gauthier D, Rybak IA, Zhang Y. Spinal V3 interneurons and left-right coordination in mammalian locomotion. Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience.

All simulations were performed using the custom neural simulation package NSM 2.5.11 
developed at Drexel University. 

Model configuration files represent:

1. nsm file for simulation of model performance in control condition for 3 frequencies 
   of oscillations (low, medium, and high) and 3 pdf files representing simulation results 
   for three frequencies;

2. nsm file for simulation of model performance when all V0 neurons were deleted for 2 frequencies of 
    oscillations (low and high) and 2 pdf files representing simulation results for 2 frequencies;

3. nsm file for simulation of model performance when V0v neurons were deleted for 2 frequencies of 
    oscillations (low and high) and 2 pdf files representing simulation results for 2 frequencies;

4. nsm file for simulation of model performance when V0D neurons were deleted for 2 frequencies of 
    oscillations (low and high) and 2 pdf files representing simulation results for 2 frequencies;

5. 3 nsm files for simulation of model performance when V3 neurons were stimulated bilaterally, 
    with low, medium, and high intensity of stimulation. For each of these nsm files the resulting 
    pdf files represent integrated neuron activity of 4 RG centers (l-F, r-F, l-E, and r-E) and 
    left V3 population (histograms), raster plots of l-V3 neuron activity, and traces of membrane 
    potentials of three sample l-V3 neurons. 

6. 4 nsm files for simulation of model performance when V3 neurons were stimulated unilaterally, 
   with low,  2 medium, and high intensity of stimulation. For each of these nsm files the resulting 
   pdf file represent integrated neuron activity of RG centers and left and right V3 populations.
